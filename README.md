Research Introduction

Sports have been playing a pivotal role in shaping societies that we are a part of. Socially or
economically, sports have a great impact on people and society itself. The sports industry is a now
significant global business sector worth billions of dollars in gate, media rights, merchandising and
sponsorship revenues (PWC, 2011) which show how impactful it is in the economy across the
world. One of the much-loved sports across the globe is Cricket. It has imprinted its presence on
almost every generation of people in the world. Like in every other sport, there have been several
advancements in different aspects of cricket as well. One of such advancements came as the
Decision Review System known in short as DRS. Under the DRS, a player may request a review of
any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not the batsman is dismissed,
with the exception of “timed out”. In other words, DRS can also be known as Umpire Decision
Review System (UDRS) where a computer-based system is used in cricket to assist the match
officials in their decision-making. There are two types of reviews, on-field umpires may choose to
consult with the third umpire which is called Umpire Review and a player may request that the
third umpire consider a decision of the on-field umpires which in this case is called a Player Review.
There are different aspects of DRS and applications of different bodies as well in DRS. The main
elements that have been used are television replays and machine learning technologies that tracks
the path of the ball and predicts what it would have done, microphones to detect small sounds
made by the ball as it hits bat or pad, and an infra-red imaging to construct a heat map of the
movement of ball to determine the impact of the ball on bat or pad. With almost all the players
and the cricket enthusiasts enjoying what the DRS has to offer, there still exist some ethical issues
on whether or not the DRS should really be implemented. Along with such issues, another major
crisis is the accuracy of the DRS system which sometimes fails to live up to the trust that it has been offered by all the cricket lovers.
There are mainly three entities in the decision review system in cricket: hot spot, hawk-eye and
snickometer. And all these systems at some times have produced some controversial results. This
has not only let down the enthusiasm of millions of people following cricket but also has raised
questions against the purpose of its existence. Although all these three systems in DRS are equally
important, this research is designed to focus mainly on the Hawk-Eye system. So, this paper intends
to discuss the ethical issues that the DRS has been facing and suggest better ways to enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of the Hawk-Eye system in DRS in cricket using the Artificial Intelligence (AI)
tools and techniques.
